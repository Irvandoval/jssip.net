h2. SIP proxies/servers

JsSIP uses the <%= my_lib_link_to "/documentation/misc/sip_websocket" %> transport for sending an receiving SIP requests and responses, and thus, it requires a SIP proxy/server with WebSocket support. Currently the following SIP servers have been tested:

* <%= my_lib_link_to "interoperability/oversip" %>
* <%= my_lib_link_to "interoperability/kamailio" %>
* <%= my_lib_link_to "interoperability/asterisk" %>
* <%= my_lib_link_to "interoperability/officesip" %>
* <%= my_lib_link_to "interoperability/resiprocate" %>
* <%= my_lib_link_to "interoperability/frafos" %>
* <%= my_lib_link_to "interoperability/teksip" %>


h2. WebRTC Web browsers

At media plane, JsSIP works with any WebRTC capable browser. Here a <%= link_to "list", "https://caniuse.com/webrtc"%> of WebRTC support in Web browsers. The use of the old RTCPPeerConnection @addStream@ method has been deprecated in favour of the newer @addTrack@ one, however this is easy to polyfill if needed as stated in the <%= link_to "specification", "https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/#legacy-interface-extensions"%>.

At signaling plane (SIP protocol), JsSIP runs in any WebSocket capable browser. Here a <%= link_to "list", "https://caniuse.com/websockets"%> of WebSocket support in Web browsers.
