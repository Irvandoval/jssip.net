h1. Failure and End Causes

JsSIP provides a set of causes in order to make the user aware of what made the request or session fail. All causes exposed here are defined in @JsSIP.c.causes@ namespace and hence, any cause received in an event providing a @cause@ field can be compared against it.

h4. Example

CODE_BEGIN "javascript"
var target = 'sip:bob@example.com';
var eventHandlers = {
  'failed': function(e) {
    if (e.data.cause === JsSIP.c.causes.BUSY) {
      coolPhone.sendMessage(target, 'Please, call me later!');
    }
  }
}

coolPhone.call(target, useAudio, useVideo, eventHandlers, views);
