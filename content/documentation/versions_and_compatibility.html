h1. Versions and Compatibility

Each JsSIP release has a version number in the form @X.Y.X@ (MAJOR, MINOR and TINY version numbers). Examples:

* 0.2.0
* 0.2.1
* 1.0.0


h2. Development engagements

* Two JsSIP versions with same MAJOR and MINOR numbers are API compatible.
* A version with same MAJOR and MINOR numbers but a greater TINY number just includes internal improvements or bug fixes.
* A version with different MAYOR or MINOR number includes new features and/or non backward compatible API changes.
