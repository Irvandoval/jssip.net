h1. 2014-10-21: JsSIP 0.4.0 Released

JsSIP version 0.4.0 has been released. This version includes several bug fixes, improvements and some API changes.

Check the "list of changes":https://github.com/versatica/JsSIP/blob/aaebc0e04500ec84626b767e686230bfdff5e884/CHANGELOG.md in this release.


h2. New features

* Hold/unhold/mute/unmute API for @RTCSession@ along with new @hold@, @unhold@, @mute@ and @unmute@ events identifying which dialog party has performed such an action.
** Yes, the SDP media direction attributes are inspected and mangled as required.
* Can receive initial INVITE or in-dialog re-INVITE/UPDATE requests without SDP offer. JsSIP will send the SDP offer in the 200 OK and expect the SDP answer in the ACK.


h2. Migrating from 0.3.x to 0.4.x

Migrating from 0.3.x to 0.4.x requires changes in your application code:

* @RTCSession@ class no longer emits @started@ event but now it emits two different events:
** @accepted@:  200 SIP response has been received/sent.
** @confirmed@:  The ACK for the 200 SIP response has been sent/received.

* @UA.register()@ no longer accepts extra headers as argument. Instead get the @Registrator@ instance of your UA via @UA.registrator()@ and call @setExtraHeaders()@ or @setExtraContactParams()@ on it.
