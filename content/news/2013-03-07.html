h1. 2013-03-07: JsSIP works in Chrome Beta for Android

Google has released Chrome M26 Beta for Android with a limited and experimental support of WebRTC (see the "announcement":https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/discuss-webrtc/uFOMhd-AG0A).

JsSIP *does* work (audio and video) in calls between Chrome desktop and Chrome Beta for Android (tested in our demo online "Tryit JsSIP":http://tryit.jssip.net):
